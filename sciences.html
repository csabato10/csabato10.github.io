							<p>Video game modifications, more commonly known in the video game community as mods, are downloadable alterations to video games. These exist in many forms, including user interface modifications, texture modifications, character embellishments, etc. Mods are typically created by fans of a game who want a change from the typical game play. However, the line between recreational and criminal becomes blurred when considering the various types of mods and the method of their creation. Much legal debate exists about this line and what features break copyright laws. Yet, legality is only a portion of this argument. At what point are these adjustments no longer adding to the original game, but completely changing it into something completely different? What makes popular mods popular, and is there potential for them to be dangerous? When given free rein to make changes, there are always possibilities for something to be taken too far. In this paper, I argue that mods are beneficial to the users as tools for engagement, but that the general practice can be damaging to players and parent companies if handled improperly. For most of this paper, I will focus on the survival crafting sandbox game Minecraft, but will not limit discussion to this game, as some negative impacts of mods do not necessarily impact it. Minecraft is a player-lead game that does not follow any exact path, but allows players to have free reign in their game play. I will cite different games and the way mods can negatively impact game experience to match these instances.</p>
							<b>What’s in a Mod?</b>
							<p>Pods are downloadable by any player from the internet and are not stand-alone games. They are designed to run on top of the parent game they are changing, meaning a Minecraft mod would require that the original Minecraft game be downloaded and playable on a user’s device to run any extra features. Research shows that mods tend to be more popular when they have received the support of the original game developer (Lee, Rajbahadur, Lin, 2020). Considering players would naturally trust the original developers of the game, it makes sense that they would trust their endorsements in mods. This would lend one to believe that players aren’t necessarily looking for a complete upending of their favorite game, but rather, small changes that make the experience enjoyable in different ways than the original game allows. In a study done on the popular game Minecraft, a team of researchers found that mods that are very descriptive and expansive are most popular with players, especially those related to world generation, texture, and armor/weapons (Lee, Lin, Bezemer 2020). While these are all specific features in Minecraft that may enhance the game for players, they are not authentic to the original game. At some level of modification, these add-ons no long act as enhancers but entire changes to someone else’s creation. Changing the look and generation of utilities in the game can take away from the natural development of the game. Pictured below in the first image is a texture pack created by. The scene looks closer to real life than the “vanilla” version of the game pictured below the first image. These modifications are beautiful and almost transfixing to the player, but they are not necessarily true to the design of the original game.</p>

							<p>Those who develop and those who play video game mods are motivated by multiple factors. In a focus group conducted on mod users and mod creators, it was determined that “perceived enjoyment,” “concentration,” and “engagement and social affiliation” were the main driving factors for using mods (Bilinska-Reformat, 11). For mod developers, they shared the “perceived enjoyment and pride” motivation with players but also emphasized “creativity,” “epistemic curiosity,” and “engagement and social affiliation” as reasons (Bilinska-Reformat, 11). Creators and players derive similar pleasures from video game mods. There is a desire to work with and connect with other people, and mods allow players to connect with those with similar interests and give developers the opportunity to actively work with creators who think in a similar way (Bilinska-Reformat, 11). A sense of community and feelings of individual satisfaction are great incentives for those using mods. It changes the way they engage with the medium and adds value to their overall experience. While Minecraft is an overarching example, role-playing games have shown to be one of the most popular games for modding (Lee, Lin, Bezemer, Hassan). The study Building the Perfect Game, attributes this to the significant amount of time players dedicate to the games. It specifically cites players logging so many hours are more likely to download modifications to make their character look exactly to their liking (Lee, Lin, Bezemer, Hassan). In this situation, giving the player more creative license over a character they design, and control can make the game more enjoyable, and does not take away from the overall game play. Instead, it allows players already devoting a lot of time to their game play the liberty to make their character more personal. These motivations and reasons for downloading and creating mods adds to individual experience, and do not take away from the overarching themes of the game they are added to.</p>

							<b>What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</b>
							<p>The exact purpose of mods cannot be easily pinpointed, as there are multiple reasons why those in the gaming community might choose to download or create mods. As I mentioned earlier, mods vary in their purpose and complexity, and different people play/create for different reasons. Those sources of motivation cited above are beneficial to users and creators, and there does not appear to be clear areas where mods could become problematic. Some players may simply want their game to take a different look, others may change whole elements of the game altogether. For example, there exists a category of video game alterations called “cheat mods”. Players with cheat mods enabled are provided with advantages that the average player does not possess, thus negatively affecting the gaming experience for themselves and any persons they play online with (Kretzchmar and Stanfill 525). They defeat the purpose of the game and remove the previously noted element of working hard and focusing that motivates most players to use mods. Pictured above is a cheat mod in Minecraft known as an “x-ray mode.” This image shows the perspective of a player who has this cheat enabled who has found a vein of diamonds. As one of the most highly sought out and difficult to find resources in the game, it can be understood why players with this enabled are unfairly advantaged. A key aspect of Minecraft is digging into the ground and happening upon these resources. This cheat code prevents the player from experiencing a core element of the game the way it is meant to be played. Cheat mods are damaging to both player and company, as they can worsen user gameplay and negatively impact the reputation and profits of the parent game company (Kretzchmar and Stanfill 522). Using these types of mods ruins the game for other players on multiplayer games and removes the need for players to get good at the game they are playing.	
								</p>
							<p>Some community members even use mods to display graphic and disturbing scenes that were not present in the original game, and have similar community and company repercussions as cheat mods (Kretzchmar and Stanfill 522). This brings me back to a question I asked in the beginning about mods being dangerous. The article “Mods as Lightning Rods: A Typology of Video Game Mods, Intellectual Property, and Social Benefit/Harm” notes that players have even had their characters forced into sexual actions without the user being able to prevent or stop it (Kretzchmar and Stanfill 526). This type of imagery and modification to the game are damaging to user experience. They encourage unhealthy relationships with sex and can even traumatize players. This negatively impacts the players and the parent company, as users encountering these issues could be turned off from the game altogether.</p>
							<p>It remains true that mods offer players the ability to explore their favorite games in different ways and can “enhance user experience” (Kretzchmar and Stanfill 522). Yet, to ignore the possible negative effects would be an incomplete analysis of how mods impact their community. While it is possible for mods to improve the experience of players, developers, and the original game company, too much free reign on how a game can be changed by community members can be harmful and ruin the essence of the game. Changing the appearance and characteristics of a game can take away from playing the game in which the game creators intended. As I noted earlier when discussing characteristics of popular mods, some mod downloads are supported by developers. However, some developers are getting stingier about the ways in which the modding community can operate. Kretzchamr and Stanfill discuss when Blizzard, a videogame company, required that mods become free regardless of the legal status of donation-based mods (529). Companies attempting to regulate mods and prevent user exploitation raises a red flag about the nature of modding. Based on data about mod popularity, as well as the negative mod variations noted in the previous paragraph, it does not appear that mods can exist solely as enhancements. Mods in themselves not the vision of the parent company and the original developers of the game. Changes to game appearance and game play may be inauthentic to the intended play, and rape mods and cheat mods are examples of how allowing community members to share mods leads to negative repercussions all around.</p>
