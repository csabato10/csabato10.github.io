								<p>When I came into this class I had no experience in college writing. I wrote a few papers last semester and scored in the high B, low A range. I was not particularly satisfied with these grades given how much time I put into the essays and really wasnâ€™t sure what I could do better. I do not write for my classes often and felt slightly out of practice entering ENGL 105. In high school I was expected to write three essays in 2 hours for AP finals, and there was less emphasis on quality than on accuracy. I had heard that ENGL 105 was not a particularly difficult class but that it would require a consistent amount of work throughout the semester and I feel like I managed this well. </p>
								<p>My first project this semester was the hardest to complete for me. Researching within the natural sciences felt especially difficult because I was disconnected with what I was writing. My essay on video game modifications came from my own personal interest on the matter, but I found myself bogged down in research without much interest in what I was reading. This essay forced me to research and dig for quality sources that provided relevant material to my theme. I created my thesis with an informed perspective on video game modifications and worked to ensure it did not limit my paper or inaccurately convey the data I planned to discuss. I am familiar with quote integration and fluid transitions, so this essay just felt like more practice with well-informed research and argument formatting.</p>
								<p>For my Unit 2 project, I struggled with balance over everything. I found it difficult at times to keep the mood of my argument reflective of the tone of the information. I as if I was writing too much about non-researched information and that it would impact the strength of my argument. Meeting the time requirement stressed me out a little because I could hear myself getting redundant at times. Natural sciences are the research areas I am most familiar with and for that reason I had the most actual fun completing this project. I enjoyed the topic a lot and found it easy to integrate quotes from my research into my argument.</p>
								<p>The final project was the most confusing for me but I appreciated the ability to be creative outside the traditional view of writing. This project forced me to think about the story I was analyzing in a different way from being taught. I have read Macbeth before but forming my own argument using quotes from the story was difficult to do while still trying to keep the player within the game. This project allowed a lot of creativity which I feel like I do not get to do often as someone who spent most of high school writing book analysis and research papers. I chose to write in a similar fashion to the original Macbeth story without copying directly, and it definitely improved my ability to write in different styles.</p>
								<p>I am proud of all of my work this semester and can safely say that I have put in the work for them. I often put English on the backburner because I am STEM focussed, but I enjoyed all the projects in this class. I am never sure how I feel about the grammar of a paper despite how many articles I read and classes I take. I foresee myself getting better with syntax the more I write and the projects I completed in this class made me think about my writing in unique ways. I have never written a game as an argument or created a video essay, but the mediums required me to adapt and I believe I did well with that. Above everything else, I will definitely be leaving ENGL 105 a better researcher and a better editor. I made the recommended changes to my Unit 1 project and cleaned it up with the hopes that I improved the clarity of my essay.</p>
