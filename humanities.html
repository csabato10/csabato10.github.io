								<p>Classic literature appears multiple times in the years students spend in an English class. Whether it be the love stories of Jane Austen or the journeys through life written by Charles Dickens, almost all students will be exposed to the stories aptly termed “classics”. Perhaps one of the most widely known and respected writers of this illustrious genre is William Shakespeare. Writing during the Renaissance era in Europe, Shakespeare created one of the largest expanses of literature ever seen, and his most famous plays have been performed for centuries and readapted repeatedly for new audiences to enjoy. Shakespearean plays will likely never be removed from all classrooms, but the presence of the literature does not imply comprehension of its lessons. Based on the success of Shakespearean adaptations and success with non-traditional strategies to teach literature, a game adaptation of the classic play, Macbeth, would improve student comprehension of the dangers brought on by pride and power.</p>
								<p>Often when beginning new literature in an English class, students will be tasked with individual readings and then participating in discussions in class. There may be a quiz or worksheets to go along with the work, but the journey through the story is often a monotonous one. Shakespeare’s plays possess rich characters and stories that comment on the timeless foibles of society. Many years ago, an article was published in the English Journal emphasizing the benefits of teaching Shakespeare through a performative medium. The method emphasized “the illusion of the first time”, and the need to “keep in mind at all times that these were real people in a lifelike situation” (Ladd 376).  Putting oneself in the perspective of the characters and feeling like their decisions are made in that moment helps connect students to the reading and better understand the character’s intentions. While this article was written a long time ago, this instructional strategy is still present in classrooms today. The complexity of Shakespearean literature does not diminish over time, and one of the largest barriers to comprehension is understanding the text at all. By taking the story off the page, understanding the story becomes easier and student engagement grows.</p>
								<p>Macbeth is one of Shakespeare’s greatest and most renowned plays. It tells the tale of a man who is destroyed by his obsession with power. Macbeth faces choices throughout the play brought onto him by the people around him. It could be easy to say that Macbeth’s decisions were entirely influenced by his wife, however he makes the final decisions that lead to his downfall. At the very beginning of the play Macbeth meets the witches he does not believe their prophecies, saying “Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more: By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be king” (Shakespeare 1.3.73-76). He is unmarred by the idea of becoming king, believing it to be impossible. Yet when he is dubbed the Thane of Cawdor moments later, his thoughts become malicious. Macbeth’s tale is that of a man obsessed with status and fulfilling his destiny. He trusts people who are notoriously deceptive and chooses to listen to the voices of destruction in his life. His wife, Lady Macbeth, encourages him to kill Duncan, saying “Your hand, your tongue. Look like th’ innocent flower, But be the serpent under ’t,” (Shakespeare 1.5.76-78). This line not only creates some of the most powerful imagery in the play but signifies the shift Macbeth’s character. Should he choose to be the snake, he will be given even more chances to be deceptive in the future. If he defies his wife’s wishes, he earns the opportunity to live in peace, knowing that he choose the path of least violence.
								</p>
								<p>      One of the most important things to note in Macbeth are the places that Macbeth chooses to act. For example, Macbeth makes the decision to kill Duncan and chooses that the “False face must hide what the false heart doth know” (Shakespeare 1.7.95). He allows Lady Macbeth’s insults of his manhood to influence his mind and decides to kill the king. Macbeth’s decision making is sporadic and often chooses to ignore the signs right in front of him. He waves off the witch’s warning saying “Who can impress the forest, bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root? Sweet bodements, good!” (Shakespeare 4.121.109-110). By choosing not to head the warning of the apparitions, despite the last prophecies of the witches coming to fruition, he seals his own fate. In the game, there is no choice offered to Macbeth here. He has already made the decisions that sealed his fate and his pride will eventually lead to his destruction. The danger of pride is also highlighted in this game in an untraditional way from the original play of Macbeth. When Macbeth chooses to not kill Banquo after killing Duncan, the story has Banquo killing Macbeth in an effort to fulfill the prophecy of his sons. This happens on a separate path as well, and are present in the game to demonstrate that no one is too good to fall as result of their hubris.</p>
								<p>Macbeth teaches about the dangers of pride and what happens to those who value power over integrity. These lessons are important to learn, but for students who are unfamiliar with Shakespearean language, the message gets lost. By creating engaging tools to enjoy and learn from the Tragedy of Macbeth, people of all ages, especially students, can be exposed to the themes of Shakespeare without being discouraged or taken out of the story by the language. Macbeth’s choices led to his own downfall and understanding where his pride got the better of him is a lessen to those who believe power is greater than humility. By recognizing the crossroads that Macbeth faced, readers can see where Macbeth choose malice over morality.</p>
